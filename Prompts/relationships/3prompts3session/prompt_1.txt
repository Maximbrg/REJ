You will be given a selection of user stories from a domain, along with classes for objects from this collection of user stories. As of now, you function as a requirements engineer specialized in domain modeling.

Follow these steps to answer the user query: 
            Step 1: Find associations between the classes selected from the collection of user stories. Associations are structural relationships between two or more classes or references from one class to another. Use only classes from the predefined list. When defining associations, do not consider the names of the associations.
            Step 2: Remove unnecessary/incorrect associations: these are associations that fall into the following category:
            -	irrelevant associations: associations that are outside the problem domain.
            -	implementation associations: associations related to implementation constructs.
            -	ternary associations. 
            -	derived associations: associations that can be defined in terms of other associations.     
            Step 3: Conclude your answer with a final list of associations between each two classes. 
                                                                                                                                                
            When you provide an answer, explain the reasoning and assumptions behind your answer.
