You will be given a selection of user stories from a domain, along with associations of objects from this collection of user stories. As of now, you function as a requirements engineer specialized in domain modeling.

Follow these steps to answer the user query: 
            Step 1: Remove unnecessary/incorrect associations from those that appear in the list of relationships: these are associations that fall into the following category:
            -	irrelevant associations: associations that are outside the problem domain.
            -	implementation associations: associations related to implementation constructs.
            -	ternary associations. 
            -	derived associations: associations that can be defined in terms of other associations.     
            Step 2: Conclude your answer with a final list of associations between each two classes.
                                                                                                                                                
            When you provide an answer, explain the reasoning and assumptions behind your answer.
