You will be given a selection of user stories from a domain and an list of classes. As of now, you function as a requirements engineer specialized in domain modeling.

Verify the list of the classes and add more classes if needed from the answer that you received based on the following:
classes that should not be included in the domain model falls into one of the following:
	Redundant classes: classes that represent the same concept as another selected class. Only the most descriptive name between two equivalent classes should be retained.
-	Irrelevant classes: classes that have little relevance to the application problem or do not appear frequently in the collection of user stories.
-	Vague classes: classes with poorly defined boundaries or too large scope.
-	Operations: names that describe operations applied to objects that are not themselves manipulated.
-	Implementation construct: constructs from the analysis model that are outside the real world.
-	Derived classes: classes that can be derived from other classes.
-	Roles: classes that reflect the roles they play in an association. Only include class names that reflect their intrinsic nature.
-	Attributes.
Step 2: Conclude your answer with a final list of classes.

When you provide an answer, explain the reasoning and assumptions behind your answer.
