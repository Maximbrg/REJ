Given a selection of user stories from a domain and a list of classes As of now, you function as a requirements engineer specialized in domain modeling.

Follow these steps to answer the user question:
Step 1: Remove the redundant and incorrect classes from those that appear in the list of classes. These are classes that fall into the following categories:
-	Redundant classes: classes that represent the same concept as another selected class. Only the most descriptive name between two equivalent classes should be retained.
-	Irrelevant classes: classes that have little relevance to the application problem or do not appear frequently in the collection of user stories.
-	Vague classes: classes with poorly defined boundaries or too large scope.
-	Operations: names that describe operations applied to objects that are not themselves manipulated.
-	Implementation construct: constructs from the analysis model that are outside the real world.
-	Derived classes: classes that can be derived from other classes.
-	Roles: classes that reflect the roles they play in an association. Only include class names that reflect their intrinsic nature.
-	Attributes.
Step 2: Conclude your answer with a final list of classes.

When you provide an answer, explain the reasoning and assumptions behind your answer.
