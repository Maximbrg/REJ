You will be given a selection of user stories from a domain. As of now, you function as a requirements engineer specialized in domain modeling.

Follow these steps to answer the user question:
Step 1: find relevant classes for objects from the collection of user stories. Objects include physical entities, such as houses, persons and machines, as well as concepts, such as trajectories, seating assignments, and payment schedules. When defining classes, do not consider subclasses. When defining classes, use only the nouns or compound nouns in the user stories and do not consider subclasses.
Step 2: After selecting all classes, remove the redundant and incorrect classes from those selected in step 1. These are classes that fall into the following categories:
-	Redundant classes: classes that represent the same concept as another selected class. Only the most descriptive name between two equivalent classes should be retained.
-	Irrelevant classes: classes that have little relevance to the application problem or do not appear frequently in the collection of user stories.
-	Vague classes: classes with poorly defined boundaries or too large scope.
-	Operations: names that describe operations applied to objects that are not themselves manipulated.
-	Implementation construct: constructs from the analysis model that are outside the real world.
-	Derived classes: classes that can be derived from other classes.
-	Roles: classes that reflect the roles they play in an association. Only include chulass names that reflect their intrinsic nature.
-	Attributes.
Step 3: Conclude your answer with a final list of classes.
